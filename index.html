It is suitable for kite kites such as kites with spike-shaped haze structure at the end, but Cao Xueqin thinks that such kites have a sense of beauty and lose the fun of swallow kites. The winged kite was improved.

		<div>According to legend, kites such as some complex surfaces (such as characters) use a wet method in addition to the direct paste paper, which is used to increase the stereoscopic effect and detail. In addition to this, the curved curvature of the wings of the swallow kite needs special attention when it is stuck.
